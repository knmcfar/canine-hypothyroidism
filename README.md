# Canine Hypothyroidism Report 

An extended abstract was created by a small group for BIOST 536: Categorical Data Analysis to investigate the association between neuter status in canines and hypothyroidism using a multivariate logistic model on case-control data.

# Contents

This project consists of the extended abstract, from which results are redacted, and a code sample used to run the analysis. Because the data was released to the class by the Dog Aging Project, but is not permitted to be shared outside of the course, the dataset and the results are not shared. 

# Lessons Learned

This project was an opportunity for me to cement my knowledge of categorical analysis and odds ratios. I also had to keep the writing brief and easy to understand for non-statisticians.
